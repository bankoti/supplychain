# Code of Conduct

We are committed to building an inclusive community around SupplyChainOS. We expect every participant to:

- Act with respect and empathy in all interactions, online or offline.
- Provide constructive feedback focused on ideas, not people.
- Recognize and celebrate diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skill levels.

## Scope

This Code applies to all project spaces including GitHub issues, pull requests, chat channels, events, and any direct communications on behalf of the project.

## Standards

Examples of positive behaviour include helping others without judgement, offering thoughtful reviews, and acknowledging mistakes. Unacceptable behaviour includes harassment, derogatory language, personal attacks, and deliberate exclusion from project activities.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, contact the maintainers at conduct@supplychainos.dev. Reports will be handled promptly, confidentially, and in line with the Contributor Covenant incident response guidelines.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will investigate and respond to incidents with actions ranging from warnings to removal from the community. Repeated or serious violations may result in temporary or permanent bans. Decisions are final and will consider the safety and wellbeing of the community first.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant version 2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html). Changes include condensed language and project-specific contact details.
